# Sorting-Visuals

The provided HTML document implements a sorting visualizer project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Bootstrap framework for styling. This interactive web page allows users to visualize the functioning of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

**Interface**: The web page features a clean interface with a centralized container for the sorting visualization and buttons for different sorting algorithms.

**Sorting Algorithms**: The sorting algorithms included are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is associated with a dedicated button.

**Visualization**: The visualization dynamically represents the sorting process using vertical bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the value being sorted. The sorting steps are visually updated in real-time as the algorithm progresses.

**Bootstrap Styling:** The Bootstrap framework is utilized for responsive and aesthetically pleasing styling. Buttons and overall layout are enhanced with Bootstrap's predefined styles.

**Random Array Generation**:The project generates random arrays for sorting, ensuring a diverse set of data for each sorting algorithm.

**Responsive Design**: The web page is designed to be responsive and should adapt well to different screen sizes.

To use the sorting visualizer, users can click on the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array, and then choose a sorting algorithm to visualize its operation. The sorting process is animated, providing an educational and interactive experience for users interested in understanding how different sorting algorithms work.
